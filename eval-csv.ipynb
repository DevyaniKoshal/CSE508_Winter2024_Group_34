He describes the various people present at the funeral, including Snegiryov, the Captain, and Nina, Ilusha's mother. He also describes the casket in which Ilusha was buried. The narrator reflects on the fact that Ilusha's death was a tragedy, and that he was a good boy who was innocent of the crime for which he was executed. He also reflects on the fact that Ilusha's father, Alyosha Karamazov, was present at the funeral, and that he was deeply affected by the death of his son.

The author considers those who have such power to be able to raise an army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them, and those who have always need of others to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The author provides examples of German cities that are well fortified and self-sufficient, and encourages princes to provision and fortify their towns. The author concludes that a prince who has a strong city and had not made himself odious will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace.\n\nPrompt: Summarize scene 4 from the book: Twelfth Night, or What You Will.act 2\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# from rouge import Rouge\n\n# eval_summary_1 = df.iloc[0]['generated summaries']\n# ref_summary_1 = df.iloc[0]['summary_text']\n\n\n\n# def get_rouge_scores(text1, text2):\n#     rouge = Rouge()\n#     return rouge.get_scores(text1, text2)\n\n# eval_1_rouge = get_rouge_scores(eval_summary_1, ref_summary)\n# eval_summary_4 = df.iloc[3]['generated summaries']\n# ref_summary_4 = df.iloc[3]['summary_text']\n\n# eval_4_rouge = get_rouge_scores(eval_summary_4, ref_summary_4)\n# eval_4_rouge\n\n\n# Instantiate the BERTScorer object for English language\n# from bert_score import BERTScorer\n\n# scorer = BERTScorer(lang=\"en\")\n\n# # Calculate BERTScore for the summary 1 against the excerpt\n# # P1, R1, F1_1 represent Precision, Recall, and F1 Score respectively\n# P1, R1, F1_1 = scorer.score([eval_summary_1], [ref_summary])","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
