This is determined by whether he has an abundant supply of men or money to raise an army to fight against any potential threat. If a prince is able to support himself, he should focus on provisioning and fortifying his towns, rather than defending the entire country. If a prince lacks the resources to support himself, he should focus on defending his towns and cities, which will deter potential attackers. The cities of Germany are used as an example of how a well-fortified town can deter attackers. The chapter emphasizes the importance of keeping the people of the city occupied with work and military exercises, as well as providing for their basic needs, in order to maintain their loyalty to the prince.\n\nChapter 4/1431:\nAverage ROUGE-1 Recall: 0.18704592262845932\nAverage ROUGE-1 Precision: 0.3249212053249059\nAverage ROUGE-1 F1: 0.21551509303529837\nAverage ROUGE-2 Recall: 0.025042927387673334\nAverage ROUGE-2 Precision: 0.05113603455323058\nAverage ROUGE-2 F1: 0.028238801922062524\nAverage ROUGE-L Recall: 0.17232266656936437\nAverage ROUGE-L Precision: 0.28850532235729875\nAverage ROUGE-L F1: 0.19494339887557616\nAverage BERTScore Precision: tensor([0.8536])\nAverage BERTScore Recall: tensor([0.8308])\nAverage BERTScore F1: tensor([0.8420])\n\n\nPrompt: Summarize scene 4 from the book: Twelfth Night, or What You Will.act 2 based on the data provided\nAnswer:  In Act II Scene IV of Twelfth Night, Duke Orsino is in his palace and asks for some music.

According to Machiavelli, a prince should have no other aim or thought than war and its rules and discipline, as this is the only art that belongs to him who rules. He argues that neglecting war leads to the loss of states, and that being unarmed makes a prince despised by his soldiers and unable to rely on them. Therefore, a prince should constantly think about war, even in peacetime, and engage in its study and practice. This includes keeping his men well-organized and drilled, studying the art of war through reading history and examining the actions of great leaders, and engaging in physical activities like hunting to prepare his body for war. By doing so, a prince can become a skilled and respected leader, capable of defending his state and inspiring loyalty in his soldiers.\n\nChapter 10/1431:\nAverage ROUGE-1 Recall: 0.17995697607002537\nAverage ROUGE-1 Precision: 0.3976889395867282\nAverage ROUGE-1 F1: 0.23030211149414742\nAverage ROUGE-2 Recall: 0.027920331012647702\nAverage ROUGE-2 Precision: 0.07871943693319323\nAverage ROUGE-2 F1: 0.03729252752310563\nAverage ROUGE-L Recall: 0.1603720115046387\nAverage ROUGE-L Precision: 0.3561452240876373\nAverage ROUGE-L F1: 0.20459535372770868\nAverage BERTScore Precision: tensor([0.8578])\nAverage BERTScore Recall: tensor([0.8291])\nAverage BERTScore F1: tensor([0.8431])\n\n\nPrompt: Summarize chapter 14 from the book: The Picture of Dorian Gray based on the data provided\nAnswer:  Chapter 14 of The Picture of Dorian Gray, titled \"The Loathsome Room,\" describes Dorian Gray's reaction to the corpse of his friend Basil Hallward.

Dostoevsky presents the character of Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov, a wealthy and successful businessman who has recently returned from France. Ivan is presented as a cynical and nihilistic figure who questions the existence of God and the morality of the world. The chapter begins with Ivan arriving at the home of his brother, Dmitri Fyodorovich, and being received coldly by him and his wife, Katya. Ivan takes note of the poverty and squalor of their home and the unhappiness of their lives. He then proceeds to engage in a philosophical debate with Dmitri, during which he argues that God does not exist and that morality is a human invention. Ivan’s views are challenged by Dmitri, who defends the existence of God and the importance of morality. The chapter ends with Ivan leaving the house and reflecting on his encounter with Dmitri, noting that he finds him to be a foolish and naive figure.\n\nChapter 12/1431:\nAverage ROUGE-1 Recall: 0.17723629999389112\nAverage ROUGE-1 Precision: 0.38473041223446774\nAverage ROUGE-1 F1: 0.22745393817977277\nAverage ROUGE-2 Recall: 0.027881385913642948\nAverage ROUGE-2 Precision: 0.07636496845292874\nAverage ROUGE-2 F1: 0.03739417980600746\nAverage ROUGE-L Recall: 0.15892807616727303\nAverage ROUGE-L Precision: 0.34670234407268535\nAverage ROUGE-L F1: 0.20355418827717378\nAverage BERTScore Precision: tensor([0.8549])\nAverage BERTScore Recall: tensor([0.8286])\nAverage BERTScore F1: tensor([0.8415])\n\n\nPrompt: Summarize chapter 57 from the book: Tess of the D'Urbervilles based on the data provided\nAnswer:  In Chapter 57 of Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Angel Clare walks automatically along the way he came, enters his hotel, sits down over breakfast, and pays his bill.
